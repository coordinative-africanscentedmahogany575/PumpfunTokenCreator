# PumpLaunch Console

PumpLaunch Console is a production-ready control center for orchestrating Solana launches. It pairs an Express API with a React dashboard so you can mint tokens, manage large wallet fleets, and execute coordinated buy/sell campaigns from a single pane of glass.
PumpLaunch Console communicates with the [PumpPortal local API](https://pumpportal.fun/) for trading and token creation on PumpFun. Review their [fee schedule](https://pumpportal.fun/fees) when planning live launches.

## Features at a Glance

- **Trading hub:** configurable batch buy/sell with sequential or concurrent execution, wallet-level overrides, and live progress tracking.
- **Wallet lifecycle:** import, generate, promote to dev, or remove wallets in one place; secret export helpers and batch removal built in. Manage SOL/SPL transfers between wallets, sweep balances into a single sink wallet, and claim creator fees straight to the dev wallet.
- **Real-time insight:** dynamic stats, selection-aware controls, and an activity log streaming backend events without noisy HTTP chatter.
- **Production defaults:** opinionated Solana endpoints, deterministic config, and JSON-based state so sessions pick up exactly where they left off.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Solana wallets funded for the dev role and any buyers you plan to automate
- Optional `.env` to override settings exposed in `src/config.js`

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (root + workspace):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Build the client bundle:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Start the production server (API + React UI on port 3000):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`, link your contract address, and begin managing wallets/trades.

### Development Workflow

- Backend only (Express + SSE):
  ```bash
  npm run server
  ```
- React dev server with hot reload (Vite on :5173):
  ```bash
  npm run client:dev
  ```
- Client bundle / preview:
  ```bash
  npm run client:build
  npm run client:preview
  ```

## Configuration & Data

| Path               | Purpose                                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `src/config.js`    | Centralised RPC URLs, fee defaults, and file locations.      |
| `wallets/dev.json` | Dev wallet (base58 secrets). Autogenerated or imported.      |
| `wallets/buyers.json` | Buyer wallets with per-wallet overrides.                   |
| `data/state.json`  | Persisted mint + UI state for fast recoveries.               |

Environment overrides include `HELIUS_RPC_URL` (preferred) or `RPC_PROVIDER`, plus file paths and default fee knobs. See `.env.example` for a complete list.

## Key Workflows

- **Link a contract:** enter a mint in the Trading Hub, use Copy/Save/Clear for quick edits, and watch the linked badge update live.
- **Manage wallets:** import via private key, batch-generate buyers, or promote/demote the dev wallet. Dev swaps automatically return the old dev to the buyer pool.
- **Batch trading:** select wallets, choose concurrent vs sequential, set buy/sell percentages, and launch `Buy Selected` / `Sell Selected`. Sequential mode hides concurrency to avoid confusion.
- **Per-wallet actions:** run targeted buy (SOL or %), sell, set dev, export secret, or remove directly from each wallet card. Dev cards highlight in green for quick identification.
- **Logs & monitoring:** the Activity Log streams backend events in real time; use the Clear button or drop into SSE for deeper observability.

## Security

- Wallet JSON files are git-ignored; make sure to secure them on shared systems.
- RPC endpoints default to Helius mainnet—review and override as needed before live trading.
- Every action triggers on-chain instructions; double-check settings (especially sell percentages) before execution.

## Troubleshooting

- **UI missing?** Re-run `npm run build` before `npm start`.
- **Balances stale?** Toggle auto-refresh or hit `Refresh Balances` in the Trading Hub.
